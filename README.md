# üîç Hybrid Search in Vector Databases with Pinecone

Welcome to the **Hybrid Search in Vector Databases** project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores how to implement hybrid search techniques using vector databases like Pinecone. Hybrid search combines the power of traditional keyword-based search with the capabilities of vector search, enabling more nuanced and relevant search results.

## üìö Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform hybrid search in a vector database using Pinecone. The notebook guides you through the entire process, from data preparation and indexing to performing complex searches. The combination of vector and keyword search allows for improved search accuracy and relevance, particularly in domains like natural language processing, information retrieval, and AI-driven search engines.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this notebook, you'll need to install several packages and set up your environment. The following instructions will guide you through the setup process.

### üîß Installation

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- **Pinecone**: A vector database service that helps manage and query vector data at scale.
  - Install: `pip install pinecone-client`
  - **Why?**: Pinecone is the core vector database used in this project, essential for storing and querying vectors.
  
- **LangChain**: A framework for developing applications powered by language models.
  - Install: `pip install langchain`
  - **Why?**: Provides tools and integrations for building applications with language models, which are useful in advanced search implementations.

- **LangChain-HuggingFace**: A shared package between Hugging Face and LangChain, facilitating seamless integration.
  - Install: `pip install langchain-huggingface`
  - **Why?**: Enables the integration of Hugging Face models within LangChain, enhancing the search and retrieval functionalities.

- **Python-dotenv**: A library for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
  - Install: `pip install python-dotenv`
  - **Why?**: Used to manage environment variables securely, such as API keys and other sensitive information required for connecting to external services.
  
### üìÇ Project Structure

- `hybrid-search-pinecone.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook that walks you through the process of implementing hybrid search.

## üìù Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. **Index Creation**
   - **Creating Pinecone Index**: The first step involves making an index in Pinecone. You should sign up at [pinecone](www.pinecone.io) to create an account. You will be able to set up your index manually as well as check the vectors created and many more options. Don't hesitate to do that FOR FREE. With Pinecone, we create an index to store our embeddings. The index is optimized for fast and accurate retrieval of vectors.
  - **Why**: Pinecone's indexing capabilities are essential for scaling vector-based search operations and ensuring quick retrieval times.

### 2. **Vectorization**
   - **Embedding Generation**: We use the `Langchain-huggingface` joint library to convert text data into dense vectors (embeddings). These embeddings are numerical representations of the text that capture semantic meaning.
   - **Why**: Embeddings allow us to perform vector-based search, which can be more nuanced and effective than traditional keyword search.

### 3. **Hybrid Search Implementation**
   - **Combining Keyword and Vector Search**: We implement a hybrid search method that combines traditional keyword search with vector search. This is done by merging the results from both searches based on relevance.
   - **Why**: Hybrid search leverages the strengths of both approaches, improving search relevance and accuracy.
